(* For each capability and struct_ref in the real system, we make a corresponding
   "direct" object. While a real capability must be converted to an export
   and sent as an integer ID over the network, its direct equivalent is included
   directly in the message content (this is possible only because we're running
   everything in a single process for testing).
   When a call is received and dispatched to a service by the CapTP system, the
   test service checks that the direct target in the message body matches the
   service's target. This ensures that the message was delivered to its intended
   recipient. *)
