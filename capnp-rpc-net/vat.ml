           Ideally, we would seamlessly merge the connections, but for now just
           reject one of them and wait for the user to retry.

           We must ensure that both ends discard the same connection though!
           The connection to keep is the one initiated by the peer with the
           highest vat ID. i.e.

           - we are connecting and have the greater ID =>
               [conn] was initiated by us, the endpoint with the higher ID

           - we are accepting and don't have the greater ID =>
               [conn] was initiated by the peer, which has the higher ID

           In those cases, we keep the new [conn].
           Otherwise, we keep the existing one.

           There are several cases to consider:

           - We decide to drop our new out-bound connection [conn] and use the existing
             in-bound one we have already accepted. The peer knows that it has accepted
             [conn] but might not know that [existing] was accepted too yet.
             If it gets confirmation of [existing] first, it will drop [conn] and just use
             that. If it gets the rejection of [conn] first, it will attempt to reconnect
             and join its existing connection attempt with [existing], which will soon
             succeed.

           - We decide to drop our existing out-bound connection and use the new
             in-bound one [conn]. When our user tries to reconnect, they will
             find the new in-bound one and succeed. The peer knows it accepted
             [conn] but may not be sure of [existing] yet. Either way, it will
             continue with [conn] without trouble.

           - We decide to drop our newly accepted in-bound connection [conn]
             and use the existing out-bound one. Since the peer has already
             approved the [existing], it no longer cares about this one.

           - We decide to drop our previously-accepted in-bound connection and
             use our new out-bound one [conn]. When the peer accepted our out-bound
             connection it already switched away from the old one.

           same digest, but a good peer won't do that)
