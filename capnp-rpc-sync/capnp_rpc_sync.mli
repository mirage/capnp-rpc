  (** [when_released t fn] will call [fn ()] when [t]'s ref-count drops to zero.
      This is used for caches, to remove entries when they become invalid.
      For promises, [fn] will be transferred to the resolution if resolved.
      For broken caps, this method does nothing (exceptions are never released). *)

  val problem : 'a t -> Capnp_rpc.Exception.t option
  (** [problem t] is [Some ex] if [t] is broken, or [None] if it is still

      If it is currently a local or remote promise, it waits until it isn't.

      before the result arrives - they will be pipelined to the service

      This is simpler than using [call], but doesn't support pipelining
      (you can't use any capabilities in the response in another message until the
      response arrives).
      On success, it returns [Ok (response, release_response_caps)].
      Call [release_response_caps] when done with the results, to release any capabilities it might
      contain that you didn't use (remembering that future versions of the protocol might add
      new optional capabilities you don't know about yet).
      If you don't need any capabilities from the result, consider using [call_for_value] instead.
